/* Software testing is making sure a program behaves how it is expected. The act of confirming it works as outlined in the software requirements. 

When writing new codes it needs to make sure it doesn't break already existing functionality, is bug free and satisfies the requirements.

Jest, Jasmine, Mocha, Karma and qUnit are all testing frameworks that can be used for javascript.

Types of testing:
1. e2e (end to end) testing
2. Integration testing
3. Unit testing


End-to-end testing:
Testing the application in the same way a normal user would use it to make sure it works.

The person testing the application doesn't have to be a developer.

They are slow and time consuming.

WebdriverJS, Protractor and Cypress or all libraries that can be used for e2e testing.


Integration testing:
Testing how parts of your system interact with other parts of your system or testing how separate parts of your apps work together.

React testing library and Enzyme are all software that can be used for integration testing.

Faster and cheaper than e2e test but not as fast as unit testing.


Unit testing:
Testing the smallest units of your source code in isolation such as function or method.

Fast to run and easy to write.
