// A javascript testing framework 

/* 

Jest uses code coverage. It covers how much of your code is covered by tests. 

Mocking:
Allows you to separate the code you are testing from its related dependencies. For example, a front end developer 
doesn't need to wait for the backend developers to write their code. You can supply it with mock data.

Jest has in-built mocking functions, it is also easy to test asynchronous code.

Snap shot testing 
Jest allows you to use snap shot testing and is used by web developers to verify that there are no regressions 
in the DOM.

// Writing tests with jest can be found in the jest folder.
