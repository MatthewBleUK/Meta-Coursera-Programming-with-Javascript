/*

When writing FP code, we keep data and functionality separate and pass data into functions only when we want something computed.


There are many more concepts and ideas in functional programming.

Here are some of the most important ones:

First-class functions

Higher-order function

Pure functions and side-effects



First-class functions:

It is often said that functions in JavaScript are “first-class citizens”. What does that mean?

It means that a function in JavaScript is just another value that we can:

pass to other functions

save in a variable

return from other functions

In other words, a function in JavaScript is just a value - from this vantage point, almost no different then a string or a number.





Higher-order functions

A higher-order function is a function that has either one or both of the following characteristics:

It accepts other functions as arguments

It returns functions when invoked

There's no "special way" of defining higher-order functions in JavaScript. It is simply a feature of the language. The language itself allows me to pass a function to another function, or to return a function from another function.




Pure functions and side-effects
Another concept of functional programming are pure functions.

A pure function returns the exact same result as long as it's given the same values.
